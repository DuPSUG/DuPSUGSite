## 📝 Adding Blog Posts
Blog posts are written in Markdown and live in the `data/blog/` directory.
Each post must include a frontmatter header:

```markdown
---
title: "DuPSUG – Autumn 2025 🍂"
date: "2025-09-23"
author: "Admin"
---
```

title → Title of the blog post

date → Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format

author → Post author (defaults to Admin if omitted)

To add a new blog post, copy an existing file in data/blog/ and adjust the header and content.

## 🔄 Deployment
Deployment is handled automatically with GitHub Actions.

* Push changes to main
* GitHub Actions will build and export the site to docs/
* GitHub Pages serves the site from the docs/ folder on the main branch

The deployed site is available at:
👉 https://dupsug.github.io/dupsugsite

```
 ┌────────────┐       ┌────────────────┐       ┌───────────────────┐
 │   Commit   │  -->  │ GitHub Actions │  -->  │ GitHub Pages (docs│
 │   to main  │       │  build & export│       │   branch folder)  │
 └────────────┘       └────────────────┘       └───────────────────┘
```

## 🐞 Troubleshooting
404s or missing CSS
Make sure basePath and assetPrefix in next.config.mjs match the repository name (/dupsugsite).

GitHub Actions build errors
Check workflow logs under .github/workflows/nextjs.yml.

Blog post not rendering
Verify frontmatter header matches the required format.
